## 3.9.1 (2023-04-27)

### Changes

* Updated the changelog. [Michele Tessaro]

### Fix

* Fixed handle of other diagram types with plantuml server. [Michele Tessaro]

  When using a PlantUML server the handling of non-uml diagrams
  (`startmindmap`, `startjson`, etc.) was building wrong open/close tags.

* Fixed urllib3 warning in output page (fixes #89) [Michele Tessaro]

  `urllib3` gives a warning when an insecure connection is used, and the
  warning is included in the output page.
  Now the warning is disabled if an insecure connection to a PlantUML
  server is used.


## 3.9.0 (2023-04-23)

* Explicitly pass charset to plantuml. [Victor Westerhuis]

  The code is explicitly encoded to UTF-8, but plantuml gets to pick its own charset. On my Windows installation it picks codepage 1252 by default, leading to wrong characters in the output. UTF-8 should be available everywhere according to the [PlantUML documentation](https://plantuml.com/unicode).


## 3.8.1 (2023-01-29)

### New

* Added option for disabling SSL checks (refs #83) [Michele Tessaro]

  Added the `insecure` configuration option for disabling HTTPS SSL

### New

* Added `preserveAspectRatio` to inline SVG diagrams. [Michele Tessaro]

  diagram.
  This can be useful for referencing the diagram in CSS rules or
  Javascript code.

* Added `remove_inline_svg_size` config option. [Anders Norman]


## 3.7.3 (2022-10-16)

### New

* Added support for server-side C4 includes (refs #76) [Michele Tessaro]

  regular expressions used to define which files can be safely included
  by the server.
  Defaults to `[r'^[Cc]4.*$']`, all C4 include files.


## 3.7.2 (2022-10-10)

  Error messages from Kroki server are rendered as text in the output.
  This is to overcome the problem that Kroki does not render errors as
  images as PluntUML does.

* Added kroki as rendering server (refs #75) [Michele Tessaro]

  With the plugin configuration `kroki_Server` is now possible to use a
  Kroki server fore remote rendering.
  Image maps are not supported by Kroki.

  and the only small used method was imported in the sources.

### Fix

* Fixed external inclusions (fixes #71) [Michele Tessaro]

  Added parsing of `!define` PlantUML directives to be able to include
  external files when the base URL is define by a variable.
  See [AWS icons Hello World](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-icons-for-plantuml#hello-world)
  for an example.

  Closes #67

* Updated notes on running tests. [Michele Tessaro]

* Fixed tests. [Michele Tessaro]


## 3.5.3 (2022-05-28)

### Changes

* Fixed code indentation in README.md. [Michele Tessaro]

### Fix

* Fixed running on Windows (fixes #63) [Michele Tessaro]

  Fixed the condition for the detection of image maps: when there are no
  image maps, in Linux the output is `\n` while on Windows it is `\r\n`,
  so in Windows image maps were detected even if not present.


## 3.5.2 (2022-02-25)

### Fix

* Fixed error with external plantuml server (fixes #61) [Michele Tessaro]

  When using an external PlantUML server to render diagrams, if a diagram
  has syntax errors and the remote server returns an error code (HTTP >=
  400), and exception was thrown immediatly stopping markdown parsing.
  Now the error is intercepted and logged, and markdown can continue its
  work.

### Changes

* Updated changelog for the new release. [Michele Tessaro]

### Fix

* There is no need to install uuid since Python 2.5 (refs #60) [Borys T]

### Changes

* Updated documentation for the new release. [Michele Tessaro]

### Fix

* Fixed read utf8 sources in Windows (refs #56) [Michele Tessaro]

  Now the `source` option expects files in the `utf8` encoding.
  In *nix nothing should change; Windows therefore uses `cp1252` as the
  default character encoding, so if you need to use that encoding you need
  to specify it in the plugin configuration options. Example:
  ```yaml
  plantuml_markdown:
      encoding: cp1252
  ```


## 3.4.2 (2020-12-19)

### Changes

* Updated CHANGELOG. [Michele Tessaro]

* Remove tests for python < 3.6. [Michele Tessaro]

  Python versions before 3.6 are now at end of life.
  `plantuml-markdown` will not be tested with those versions, and bugs
  will be fixed only if reproducible with more recent Python versions.

### Fix

* Fixed working with Markdown 3.3 (fixes #39) [Michele Tessaro]

* Fixed indentation handling (fixes #51) [Michele Tessaro]


## 3.4.1 (2020-10-28)

* Updated changelog for the new release. [Michele Tessaro]

### Fix

* Fix rendering in indented blocks (fixes #31) [Grzegorz Adamiak]

  It fixes [issue][31] with rendering indented fenced blocks. They were
  rendered only when put at beginning of the line. To illustrate, this
  block was processed correctly

      ```plantuml
      A --> B : I am processed
      ```

  while a block nested under a list item (indented) was not processed

        * A list item with nested block

          ```plantuml
          A --> B : I am not processed
          ```

  [31]: https://github.com/mikitex70/plantuml-markdown/issues/31

  With this patch the block is converted into image and correctly put in
  the document tree allowing for images nested in other block elements,
  e.g. list items.

### Changes

* Updated documentation for new release. [Michele Tessaro]

### Fix

* Renamed module to `plantuml_markdown` (fixes #23) [Michele Tessaro]

  Renamed module from `plantuml-markdown` to `plantuml_markdown` to allow
  importing module in other python sources.
  This breaks compatibility: plugin configuration in `markdown_py` must be
  renamed too.

  if the image dimension is bigger than values specified, they will be
  shrunk keeping the aspect ratio.
  If there is not enough space in the page for the diagram, the image
  will be reduced.

### Changes

* Updated documentation for new release. [Michele Tessaro]
